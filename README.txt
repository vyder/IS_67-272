Hello TA,

This Readme file has been split into sections for easy reading.

Extra Credit I have implemented:
(Note: Items that have a * are ones that have been suggested/approved by ProfH. ~ signifies I didn't have time to get them cleared by ProfH, so you should use your discretion to give me extra credit :) Thanks! )

1) *Dynamic Maps - coded from scratch in javascript (not the iframe crap) using the google maps API
		> ~Implements zoom using the scroll wheel, and UI
		> ~Street View (drag the little guy to your location)
			> ~Click on marker to open infoWindow
			> ~infoWindow has a link to get directions location
		> ~Option to change to Satellite or Map view

2) ~ Home page lists only the next 5 upcoming parties

Thanks,
Vidur
